# Noololly-Bot
This is Noololly's personal bot

All you need to do is run main.py
I recommend using nohup to keep it running while you do other things with your command line

Features:

Cat - the main feature. This will pull a cat from reddit every time you type "cat"
Meme - the second main feature. This will pull a meme from reddit every time you type "meme"
