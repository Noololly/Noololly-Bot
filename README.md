# Noololly-Bot
This is Noololly's personal bot

All you need to do is run main.py
I recommend using nohup to keep it running while you do other things with your command line

Features:

Cat - the main feature. This will pull a cat from reddit every time you type "cat"
Meme - the second main feature. This will pull a meme from reddit every time you type "meme"
Congratulate - if you type "yeeeees" (5 e's) then it will congratulate you.
Hi/Hello - if you are lonely you can talk to the bot. I am expanding this feature to an AI chatbot.
This will be using the prsaw library made by CodeWithSwastik. Link to the repo: https://github.com/CodeWithSwastik/prsaw
